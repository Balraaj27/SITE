# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect your Law Crusade website to Google Sheets for automatic enquiry data saving.

## Step 1: Create Google Apps Script

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the code from `google-apps-script.js`
4. Save the project (Ctrl+S) and name it "Law Crusade API"

## Step 2: Deploy as Web App

1. Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
2. Choose type: "Web app"
3. Description: "Law Crusade Consultation API"
4. Execute as: "Me"
5. Who has access: "Anyone"
6. Click "Deploy"
7. **Copy the Web App URL** (it looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/SCRIPT_ID/exec`)

## Step 3: Update Your Website

1. Open `src/services/googleSheets.ts`
2. Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID` in the SHEET_URL with your actual script ID from the web app URL
3. Save the file

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Go to your contact page
2. Fill out and submit the consultation form
3. Check your Google Drive - a new spreadsheet called "Law Crusade - Consultation Requests" should be created
4. Verify that the form data appears in the spreadsheet

## Step 5: Customize Your Spreadsheet (Optional)

1. Open the created spreadsheet in Google Sheets
2. Format columns as needed (dates, phone numbers, etc.)
3. Add conditional formatting for urgency levels
4. Set up email notifications for new submissions

## Troubleshooting

### If data isn't saving:
1. Check that the Google Apps Script is deployed correctly
2. Verify the web app URL is correct in `googleSheets.ts`
3. Ensure the script has permission to create/edit spreadsheets
4. Check the Apps Script execution log for errors

### If you get permission errors:
1. Re-deploy the Apps Script
2. Make sure "Execute as: Me" is selected
3. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Alternative: Google Forms Method
If the Apps Script method doesn't work, you can use the Google Forms fallback:

1. Create a Google Form with fields matching your consultation form
2. Get the form's submission URL
3. Update the `saveToGoogleForm` method in `googleSheets.ts`
4. Replace the form field entry IDs with your actual form field IDs

## Security Notes
